 # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
The project is a website for cinemas.

The project is deployed to Heroku at https://perfect-movies.herokuapp.com.

If you wish to run the project on your localhost, download it, and use the following commands:
    - npm i
    installs all the node_modules
    - npm run build
    builds the project
    - npm start
    runs the project


# Technical Solution
The project uses node.js in combination with react.js to operate, and a mySQL database which stores data.
The API of the project is built using express REST API, which connects the project to the database and fetches data.
The project uses JWT Webtoken to verify and authorize logins and registers in the project.
To see the other various modules incorporated in the project, see package.json.
